# Sudoku-backtracking-algo
Sudoku is an ancient logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective of the game is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits 1 to 9 such that each column, row, and the nine 3×3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 only once.  This project utilizes a backtracking algorithm to solve any valid sudoku puzzle.
